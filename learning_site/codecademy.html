The site has received positive feedback and reviews from many blogs and websites, including the New York Times and TechCrunch. To motivate users to participate, the site offers feedback, badges for completing exercises, as well as a function that keeps track of a user's total score and displays it to others. The site also allows anyone to create and publish a new course using a Course Creator tool.

            Codecademy was founded in 2011 by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski.[6] Sims dropped out of Columbia University to focus on launching a venture, while Bubinski graduated from Columbia with a degree in computer science and biophysics.[7] The company, headquartered in New York City, raised $2.5 million in Series A funding in October 2011 and $10 million in Series B funding in June 2012.[6][8] The latest round of funding was led by Index Ventures.
